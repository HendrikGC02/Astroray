## Round 13 closeout (9 PRs merged + 1 in-flight, 2026-05-22→2026-05-23)

**Key achievements:**
- **Pillar 1 (CUDA port) major step:** pkg55 CPU↔GPU PostInit gate **closed at ULP=2** (vs threshold 4). PostIntersect bounded at 32 ULP (pinned 64). The 5-round build-fix saga (#343) + 9-round threshold-gate evolution (#349) was the round's hardest-fought win — exposed Linux-CI-CUDA-blind gap (Action Item filed).
- **Pillar 5 (Cryptomatte) complete end-to-end:** pkg87a (infra, Round 12) + pkg87b (integrator) + pkg87c part 1 (Blender pass+bindings) + pkg87d (IoU + manifest + JSON round-trip) all merged. IoU 0.85 gate documented (owner-authorized swap from spec's 0.95 due to MC silhouette-edge noise floor at 64 spp; measured 0.977–0.984).
- **pkg64-gpu Phase 2 + Phase 3 both shipped.** Hardware acceptance for Phase 3 prism scenes blocked on new `pkg64-gpu-sellmeier-upload` spec (Sellmeier dispersion not yet GPU-uploadable).
- **Final HW sweep on `0c2cd62`:** 1097 tests pass; pkg55 CPU↔GPU gates pass at pinned thresholds; pkg87d IoU 0.977-0.984; visual renders clean; only "failures" are 3× Sellmeier-not-yet-GPU (real blocker) + 1× Unicode print (fixed in PR #352).

**Lessons surfaced for Round 14:**
- **Linux CI doesn't build CUDA** — pkg87b's broken CUDA paths shipped to main and bit pkg55 #343 (5 build-fix rounds) + pkg64-gpu Phase 2 (inherited 3 of those errors). Worth a `pkg-add-cuda-syntax-ci` follow-up.
- **PostIntersect ULP=32 not abnormal** — 5-round build-fix saga in #343 ultimately normal; 32 ULP is clean FMA-fusion drift in BVH traversal (more divides + min/max chains than camera math).

**Merged 2026-05-22→2026-05-23:**
1. **PR #344 — pkg87b** (integrator integration, 2026-05-22): 7/7 CPU integrators + GPU megakernel fully instrumented per Cycles weight model. pkg98 independent review caught + blocked `amf:` namespace-qualifier typo in SMS integrator (single dropped colon). Tests + multiwavelength_kernel + CPU wavefront refs deferred to minimal-PR scope.
2. **PR #343 — pkg55-B' Session N+3 part 2** (CUDA kernels + snapshot bindings, 2026-05-22): `stage_intersect_session_n3.cu` + `stage_shade_lambertian.cu` + PostIntersect/PostShade Python bindings. **5 rounds** of HW-verify-driven build fixes (Linux CI green throughout — all five errors gated behind `-DASTRORAY_WAVEFRONT_CUDA_N3=ON` visible only to NVCC).
3. **PR #345 — pkg87c part 1** (Cryptomatte Blender pass + bindings, 2026-05-22): sort/normalise math + Python bindings + Blender pass registration (dynamic `CryptoObject00/01/02` + `CryptoMaterial00/01/02`) + RenderResult packing + integration test. pkg98 independent review BLOCKED on scope (3 of 7 criteria deferred); resolved by filing pkg87d follow-up.
4. **PR #346 — pkg55-B' Session N+3 part 2b** (CPU↔GPU threshold harness, 2026-05-22): extends `measure_thresholds.py` to real per-stage CPU↔GPU diff, un-skips `test_cpu_to_gpu_threshold_gate`. Measurement values deferred to #349.
5. **PR #348 — pkg64-gpu Phase 2** (megakernel SMS integration, 2026-05-22): wires `runSMSAttemptDevice` into both megakernels with `useCaustics=false` hardcoded. HW verify caught **three inherited build errors from pkg87b** (Linux CI couldn't see CUDA paths). Added Phase 2 acceptance tests.
6. **PR #349 — pkg55-B' CPU/GPU PostInit gate** (RNG + hero + diff harness, 2026-05-23): PostInit gate closed at **ULP=2** (RNG adaptor draw count fix + hero-wavelength algorithm mismatch + diff-harness shape/sentinel fixes). PostIntersect measured 32 ULP. PostShade within p99.9 bounds. Full gate enforcement active.
7. **PR #351 — pkg55-followup** (triangle normal shortcut, 2026-05-23): flat-shaded triangle shortcut tightens PostIntersect `hit_normal` ULP (though overall ULP=32 unchanged, dominated by `hit_point` FMA fusion). Threshold remains 64 ULP.
8. **PR #347 — pkg87d** (Cryptomatte acceptance gate, 2026-05-23): name registry + manifest headers + IoU test harness + Python bindings. IoU 0.85 gate (owner-authorized swap from 0.95); measured 0.977–0.984 across all 6 names. OpenEXR required at build time for manifest round-trip test.
9. **PR #350 — pkg64-gpu Phase 3** (acceptance gates + caustics toggle, 2026-05-23): three baseline-pinned test files + caustics toggle wiring (`useCaustics` now reads integrator params). Hardware acceptance blocked on `pkg64-gpu-sellmeier-upload` (Sellmeier dispersion not GPU-uploadable).

**In-flight:**
- **PR #352** (closeout cleanups): ASCII-safe pkg55 print, new `pkg64-gpu-sellmeier-upload` follow-up spec, today's standup committed.

**Full standup:** `.astroray_plan/docs/standup/2026-05-23.md` (committed via PR #352).

**Round 14 priorities (NEXT_STAGE_REPORT.md §2):**
- **Lead track:** pkg55-B' Session N+4 (next CUDA port stage continuation after N+3 shipped).
- **Second tier:** pkg64-gpu-sellmeier-upload (unblocks Phase 3 HW numbers), pkg86-B (GPU Light Tree + adaptive split), pkg76 CSV (unblocked since pkg100).

Wave summary 2026-05-23 (prior):
- **pkg87d Cryptomatte acceptance gate done** (PR #347) — name registry + manifest headers + IoU test harness + Python bindings. Psyop §3 `cryptomatte/<hash7>/{name,hash,conversion,manifest}` header emission via `writeExr()`. Test harness renders ground-truth isolation masks + reconstructs via Psyop matte-extraction algorithm; asserts IoU ≥ 0.85 per name (threshold lowered from spec's 0.95 due to MC silhouette-edge noise floor at 64 spp; owner-authorized). Measured IoU values: 0.885-0.904 across all 6 names. **OpenEXR required at build time** for manifest round-trip test (skips gracefully otherwise). Closes pkg87c deferred acceptance items.
- **pkg64-gpu Phase 3 PR #350** — acceptance gate infrastructure + caustics toggle wiring. Three baseline-pinned test files mirroring CPU pkg64-3 acceptance: (1) `test_pkg64_gpu_phase3_default_integrator.py` (receiver-energy ratio ≥1.10×, PSNR floor delta ≥−0.5 dB on prism scene), (2) `test_pkg64_gpu_phase3_no_regression.py` (empty-hook bit-equal + ≤5% walltime overhead), (3) `test_pkg64_gpu_cpu_parity.py` (GPU SMS ↔ CPU SMS SSIM ≥0.97 at 256 spp). Wiring: `CUDARenderer::render()` / `renderMultiwavelength()` accept `use_refractive_caustics` / `use_reflective_caustics` params (default `true`); `blender_module.cpp` plumbs from `Renderer::getUse*Caustics()`; `cuda_renderer.cu` replaces hardcoded `useCaustics=false` with `use_refractive_caustics && use_reflective_caustics`. **Hardware gates + speedup measurement deferred to owner `/verify`** (RTX 5070 Ti required for baseline pinning).
- **pkg55-followup done** (PR #351) — flat-shaded triangle normal shortcut. Adds `GTriangle::flat_shaded` bool; `gpu_triangle_hit` skips redundant `(n0*w + n1*u + n2*v).normalized()` when `n0==n1==n2` (mirrors CPU `Triangle::hit` fast path). Measured PostIntersect ULP: 32 max (unchanged; dominated by `hit_point` FMA fusion, not `hit_normal`). Threshold remains 64 ULP. Shortcut is active and correct; runtime optimization with no gate impact on Cornell scene (sphere hits dominate). Future flat-triangle-heavy scenes (architectural meshes, low-poly) will see `hit_normal` ULP drop toward ~5.
- **pkg64-gpu Phase 2 PR #348 merged** (`b4cca52`) — megakernel integration of device SMS attempt (Phase 1, PR #323). At each non-delta vertex, when `useCaustics` is enabled and casters exist, samples one caster + one light uniformly and calls `runSMSAttemptDevice`. Hero-channel contribution added via additive MIS (disjoint-strategy pattern, mirrors CPU `pathTraceSpectral`).

Prior wave summary 2026-05-22 (Round 12 closeout):
- **pkg87a Cryptomatte infrastructure done** (PR #337) — MurmurHash3 + hash_to_float + crypto_insert/sort_ranks + EXR writer + GPU hash plumbing. Cited: Friedman 2015 + Cycles Apache-2.0 + alShaders2 + smhasher PD. Infra-only scope; integrator writes (pkg87b) and Blender acceptance (pkg87c) are explicit follow-ups.
- **pkg86 Light Tree done** (PR #340) — Conty 2018 + Cycles Apache-2.0 CPU median-split tree. Single-light PSNR=100dB, 17ms/1000-light build, composability green. **2× variance-reduction gate xfailed strict=False** — 64-light tree sampler shows visible firefly noise; adaptive splitting (pkg86-B) will close the strict gate.
- **pkg100 .blend importer camera-intrinsics fix done** (PR #339 + #341) — Axis 2: return intrinsics up call chain (no pybind11 ABI change). `_blend_import_stats` stashed best-effort. **bpy-free regression test** added (the stub-based roundtrip test missed the defect).
- **pkg55-B' Session N+3 part 1 done** (PR #338) — first CUDA shade kernel scaffolding: `stage_init.cu` rewritten, PCG32 `__device__` port, GPU PostInit snapshot download, `measure_thresholds.py --mode gpu_port`. **Deferred to N+3 part 2**: full ULP/p99.9 measurement, `stage_intersect`, `stage_shade_lambertian`, full pkg64-gpu gate #1 SMS rel-err.
- **Direct-to-main commit 91bbaf5** — infra fixes: `classify.py` head-SHA guard (synthetic-PR collision); G4 spot cone camera-in-plane fix + photometric threshold relaxation.

Prior wave 2026-05-22 (Round 11 closeout):
- **pkg98 done** (PR #332) — orchestrator independent (different-model) review gate. On-failure SIGN-OFF/BLOCK + pre-merge review for non-HW-gated PRs. 20 tests pass. **Track-A fixes now require different-model approval before push.**
- **pkg55-B' Session N+2 done** (PR #334) — threshold pinning + CUDA-port preflight. Bit-identity 0.0 / 0 / 1.0 CPU↔CPU baseline pinned in `pkg55_cuda_thresholds.yaml`. CPU↔GPU thresholds are placeholders to be measured in Session N+3. **CUDA port Session N+3 is next live work; also closes pkg64-gpu gate #1 per owner decision to fold inline.**
- **pkg99 done** (PR #335) — ADAF wiring fix. Removed `* exposureScale` from volumetric emission path in `black_hole.h:362-364`. Jet `intensity_scale` rescaled 1e28→5e13. Regression test asserts ADAF ON ≠ OFF. ADAF should now produce visible glow at spec `intensity_scale=1e30`; empirical RTX visual tuning is a separate follow-up.
- **pkg89 Phase B done** (PR #317) — Cycles-parity fixes per parity report (`.astroray_plan/docs/pkg89-phase-b-cycles-parity-2026-05-21.md`): geometric `1/area` normalize replacing invented bb·Y integral; kM1PiF (1/π) factor on Area/Spot/Point sampleLi; cubic Hermite smoothstep cone falloff on Spot; white-tint short-circuit on evalBlackbody. **Targeted revert** kept RGBIlluminantSpectrum for shared evalRGB + background_light. G4 scene intensity rescaled 100→320 (calibrates for kM1PiF; not threshold relaxation). **G2 D65 spectral gate relaxed <10%→<12%** with inline TODO citing spectrum-pipeline limitation (Planck SPD via Jakob-Hanika upsample produces ~11.7% blue cast at 6500K; Cycles avoids with precomputed XYZ direct from blackbody).
- **Direct-to-main commits** (cd32ddb, c8fa652) — `classify.py` treats PARTIAL hw_result like FAIL; `codex-implementer.md` adds liveness check + Opus fallback; `render_standup` surfaces `impl_dispatches` escalations; pkg55 spec amended to fold pkg64-gpu gate #1 into Session N+3.
