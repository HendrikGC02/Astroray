# pkg241 Phase 2 — UI event latency while a viewport chunk renders

Generated: 2026-09-08T05:16:29Z  
Bridge: 127.0.0.1:9877  
Protocol: 3x10.0s per config, 2.0s warmup discarded, tick_s=0.005.

Budget: UI-latency-during-render p95 <= 33.0 ms (30 fps).

## tick-gap (ms) -- lower is more responsive; ~tick_s means fully decoupled

`render_frac` (Astroray only -- time inside `Exporter.render_viewport_frame` / total wall time) cross-checks `blocked_frac` (derived purely from tick gaps, so it applies to Cycles too, which has no Python view_update/view_draw hook to wrap): the two should track together on the Astroray rows, confirming the tick gaps are real render blocking and not a timer-throttling artifact. Cycles rows are expected to show `render_frac`=0/None (no Astroray render calls happened -- Cycles is native C++, no Python hook to wrap) alongside a low `blocked_frac` and a nonzero, growing `n_presents` (proving the viewport kept refining, not merely idling), demonstrating the decoupled reference the owner described.
